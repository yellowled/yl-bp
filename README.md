# My HTML5 boilerplate

This is what [I](http://twitter.com/yellowled) usually use to start HTML5 projects.

Now uses [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) build script, so do `npm install` first to install required grunt modules locally.

**TODO:** As of now, HTML files will not work properly since they don't include scripts/plugins.js, which is being combined with scripts/main.js in the build process.
